## Editing this theme
### SCSS
The CSS is generated by compiling the SCSS files. 
In order to do so, make sure you have installed Node.js and NPM globally on your computer. Then run `npm install` from your terminal/command line to install all the dependencies. Run the watcher by running `npm run scss`. The watcher will automatically compile a new `style.css`-file everytime you change something in a `.scss`-file.
