## Other work
I did other work as well

### K-Bit.dev
I designed the website of K-Bit.dev https://k-bit.dev/
The development of it wasn't in my hands, although I was asked to help on some components. These can be found on my Codepen: https://codepen.io/collection/ExKeRW

### 24Letters
We started working on a website called 24Letters. The website itself isn't live yet, but I did work on a 'growing tree on scroll', that can be found on my Codepen: https://codepen.io/samanthabrouwer/pen/PojoPOY (start scrolling to show the tree)

### Samantha-online.nl
I designed and developed my personal website, Samantha-online.nl. It is still a work in progress, but the website can be found on https://samantha-online.nl/ and code on this github (one folder up to see the repository).

## Older work
No code to show, unfortunately, since it lives in private repositories of companies I don't have access to anymore. Altough you can always open up your developer tools and check the source.

### Nationale Vacaturebank (2018)
While working at DPG Media, I worked with one of the teams on Nationale Vacaturebank. We worked on the recruiter part, that can be found on https://www.nationalevacaturebank.nl/recruiter/
The header and footer are web components (created by another team), but we were responsible for the main part. I created the html and scss for the filter bar and the candidates.
We also worked on the onboarding flow and jobseeker profile, that starts here: https://www.nationalevacaturebank.nl/profiel/registreren/email. I also created the html and scss for these parts.

### Cartel Internet & Marketing (2015)
Although Cartel merged with Uname-IT, the (old) website that I developed is still online, and be found on https://www.cartel.nl/

### Other work
A lot of work I did is either not online anymore or hidden in a private repository. Check my LinkedIn profile for a full overview of websites that I worked on: https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanthabrouwer90/
